# LLFF Toolbox
Allows people to try out Fyusion's Local Light Field Fusion code without high-end hardware.

## Usage
1. Create a folder named "LLFF_data" in your Google Drive containing the subfolders "in" and "out"
2. To generate an MPI from multiple images, copy them into a new folder called "images" in the previously created "in"
3. Then just open the Jupyter Notebook in Colab and follow the instructions there
